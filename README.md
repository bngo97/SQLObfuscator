# SQLObfuscator

This is the final proejct for EE 379K: Enterprise Network Security. We provide a script that takes in a SQL payload and returns an obfuscated payload. The code can be run as follows:

```
python3 obfuscator.py [command]
```

Where command is the payload. The script will print the obfuscated payload to the console.
